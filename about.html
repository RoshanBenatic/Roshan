The transformation journey at Raymond is conceptualised to create a new-age organisation that is geared to outpace competitors and drive higher growth and
profitability. Adapting an asset-lightapproach with a strong focus on ROCE will enable us to not just survive but thrive in this volatile marketplace. Since
 inception, Raymond has been heralded for creating numerous pioneering innovations in turn creating a leadership position for itself in the market. As the

 of Skill India and Make in India initiativesby the Government, presents an untapped opportunity for the Indian textile sector, which is the second largest employment 
generator after agriculture. Strengthening our manufacturing prowess by establishing
 Greenfield manufacturing facility in Amravati region in Maharashtra is a reaffirmation of our commitment to ‘Make in India’ initiative. In our endeavour to Skill India
